## Introduction

**Chatter** has ability to integrate with various LLMs like ChatGPT, GPT4ALL, and others, which means you can integrate any LLMs as **Model** plugins. In addition, the app enables not just models interaction, but has ability to enable models to act or behave, such as book a restaurant with the support of **Action** plugins. Thus, thanks to its extensibility, users can write and provide their own plugins to integrate with various models and to support more actions.
